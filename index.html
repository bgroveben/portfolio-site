            <div class="subheading mb-3">Rocks, Minerals, Gems, and Amber</div>
            <p>I co-founded this company during the COVID-19 pandemic that hit my adopted hometown of Las Vegas like a 22 at the Blackjack table. I love running restaurants, but I realized that I needed to do more than work smarter and harder at my current job in order to stay employed. I would also have to adapt my learning techniques, diversify my skillset, and overcome challenges if I was going to succeed in this town. I was born and raised in Colorado, which is probably why I have always had an interest in pretty rocks, gems, and jewelry. That's good enough for me to accept the challenge of running my very own business. May fortune favor the bold, the brave, and the foolhardy.

            <p>I manage the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, bar, and club with the best view of the Fremont Street Experience. I train and supervise my staff of cooks, servers, bartenders, dishwashers, security team, and various other personnel. I make sure that my saloon is staffed, stocked, maintained, and held to the highest standards of hygiene, sanitation, and safety. That way my crew and I can feed and entertain your in-laws, outlaws, and everyone in between.
            </p>
            <p>I love my job and the people I work with, but my beloved saloon is, like so many other businesses right now, struggling financially due to the coronavirus pandemic. My staff and I have done our best to keep up with all of the changes, and we have a newfound respect for hygiene and sanitation. We have been compelled to shut down, reopen, lay off staff, and above all keep our customers and my employees safe during these difficult times. Still, I love what I do, I’m determined to keep on doing it, and I’ll do what it takes to get my saloon and staff through the tough times. I have to stay on my toes and be prepared, just like so many other folks these days.</p>

            <p>I supervised the day-to-day activities of subordinates while completing the opening, daily and closing shifts. I coordinated with management for training of new associates. I also handled the cash and financial transactions such as voids and assignings banks to subordinates. I oversaw food safety, sanitation, and made sure that my restaurants and bars were held to company standards as well as HAACP-compliant and ready for inspection by the NSF and local Health Department. I helped with inventory, ordering, deliveries, transporting liquor to the units, covering breaks and trying to find coverage for employee call-outs, scheduling and re-scheduling, all while keeping all of my units up and running. Even with all of this to handle, I still made sure to make time for all of my employees as well as handle customer complaints and any disputes that arose between personnel.
