            <p>I co-founded this company during the COVID-19 pandemic that hit my adopted hometown of Las Vegas like a 22 at the Blackjack table. I love running restaurants, but I realized that I needed to do more than work smarter and harder at my current job in order to stay employed. I would also have to adapt my learning techniques, diversify my skillset, and overcome challenges if I was going to succeed in this town. I was born and raised in Colorado, which is probably why I have always had an interest in pretty rocks, gems, and jewelry. That's good enough for me to accept the challenge of running my very own business. May fortune favor the bold, the brave, and the foolhardy.
